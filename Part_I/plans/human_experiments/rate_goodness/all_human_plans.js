An easy way to make a new pair of shoes without using leather is to 3D print a pair of shoes from an already existing blue print. Based on your skill set, you can either design your own blue print or find one online. While this is an easy way to make a new pair of shoes, it might not be the most comfortable. A secondary plan is to identify the type of shoe you want to make, design the shoe using cloth materials and a rubber sole, and sew your new shoes. This takes much more knowledge of the art of sewing.",
