As you make your way collecting one dirty dish at a time and clearing liquid or large amounts of food from surface into trash, bring the collection of dirty dishes to a reachable counter space next to dish washer. Note, stack well and safely, by putting all flat dishes on each other, and utensils on top of that dish pile or inside an empty dirty cup. Do not stack a dish with utensils and another dish with utensils directly on each other. Do not stack dishes on top of each other that have food on them. this prevents accidents of a pile of dishes from falling and breaking, and possibly hurting you by falling on your foot. After all the dirty dishes are stacked to an arms reach next to the dish washer, open the dish washer and pull out wire rack drawer at the bottom first. Place all the dishes in one at a time using the rack seperation design to stand up the dish securely. The same is for bowls and dinner ware. Place all utensils in the smaller baskets. Next pull out second wire rack on the top most part, this is for cups and larger serving utensils. use the Wire rack design to load each cup individually facing down. the bottoms of the cups should all be seen from top view. After all the dirty dishes are loaded properly, locate the internal dish washer soap dispenser. Add the appropriate soap to the dispenser and close the dish washer door. Closing the dish washer door should also close in all the racks with loaded dishes. if you hear dishes hitting each other, you have loaded the racks improperly, and you need to  open the dishwasher and fix where the dishes are not properly secure.
