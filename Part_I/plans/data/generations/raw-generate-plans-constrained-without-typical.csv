This will help people be able to visualize just how big of a task this is. Explain that you wont be using lights and if there is logical reasoning's why make sure to include them. Reach out to local news stations and see if they can help share your story. A lot of times news stations will include a cropped screenshot of the social media post in question. This will also help spread your post. Once you have people aware that you will be decorating a tree this big you can start accepting decoration donations. You can also have school teachers let their students make decorations by either coloring a paper cut out in the shape of an ornament or they can get crafty and use other supplies. Once you have all the decorations you need to make a plan of action. The easiest and safest method to get high enough to decorate the top of the tree. I would recommend renting a boom lift, which looks like a small crane and has a platform and controls at the end of the arm. This will allow you to get up off the ground and high enough to decorate the top of the tree. This will also be the safest option because it was designed to help workers safely get in hard to reach areas high above the ground. Once you have the machinery figured out take a look at all your decorations. If you are wondering if you have enough ration them. you can always go back and add more in. as long as you dont have large gap areas it will still look good. if you are allowed to have people help then use them! have helpers work on the bottom while you focus on the top. Regardless if you have help or not I recommend working from the top down. it will be easier to decorate the bottom because you wont need the boom lift. save the easiest stuff for last, you will be tired by then. the next step is to execute your plan! after you execute, you are done.""}","""",test,Decorate the world's largest Christmas tree.,generate plans,without using lights
