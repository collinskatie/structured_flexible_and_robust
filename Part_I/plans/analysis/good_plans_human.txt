Goal: Bake a cake.	Generation: The first step of baking a cake is deciding what type of cake. There are plenty of pre made boxes at your local grocery store with a galore a flavors and icings to choose from to complement your desired cake mix. Make sure to pick up some sprinkles or candles if its a birthday cake! Once you make it home from the store, you will read the directions on the back of the box and preheat your oven to the designated temperature. Next you will grab a good size bowl and mix the ingredients together, making sure there are no lumps. Next you will pour into a coated/nonstick pan and bake until your desired consistency is achieved. After it cools, removed the cake from the pan and decorate to your choosing! Enjoy!.

Goal: Keep the plants in your garden alive.	Generation: Keeping plants alive in a garden takes several steps. To start at the root of the problem it's worth checking the quality of the soil. You can achieve this by purchasing a do-it-yourself kit that measures the acidity and alkalinity of the soil, etc. Once that is handled, you will need to follow instructions based on the type of plant for sunlight exposure, watering habits, etc. It would also be advisable to create a barrier so that pets and other wildlife cannot eat or destroy the plants.

Goal: Put out a fire that started near the wires from your TV.	Generation: To put out the fire, I will get my fire extinguisher rated for electric fires. I will then use the PASS technique - PULL, AIM, SQUEEZE, SWEEP, while my housemate calls 9-1-1. If the fire does not go out using the fire extinguisher I will step aside while the firefighters put out the fire.	Median Rating: 7.0	Median Rating: 6.375	All Ratings: [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 7, 4, 7]
Goal: Fix a flat tire.	Generation: To fix a flat tire, I will pull over to the side of the road safely with my hazard lights on. I will then get out my jack, jackstand, tire iron, and spare tire. I will put my jackstand under the car and use the jack to lift the car up to the desired height. I will then use the tire iron to loosen the lugnuts. Then I will use the jack to lift the car the rest of the way and make sure the jackstand is secure as well. I will loosen the lugnuts the rest of the way and remove the tire. Then I will replace it with the spare tire. After that I will tighten the lugnuts all the way in a star pattern. Then I will lower the tire using the jack, removing the jackstand. I will put all my tools away. I will then take the tire to a shop which will assess the tire and determine if it can safely be patched or will need to be replaced.

Goal: Protect the deer in your nearby woods during hunting season.	Generation: 1. Be aware of hunting laws, protect yourself form protective gun owners. 2. If you suspect poaching, call the game warden. 3. Create a movement for protecting deer in your local community and discouraging the hunting of these animals. (You MUST have valid reasoning, i.e. the gunshots scaring children in the neighborhood, flying bullets as a potential danger to humans. Otherwise, no one will listen to you since it is legal in hunting season). 4. Get a following for your movement. 5. Create a local petition and a general sense of unity on the issue through the use of social media, discussion forums, and whatever else suits your community.

Goal: Play baseball with your friends.	Generation: Need to determine type of game. Full on 9 v 9 baseball? Wiffle-ball in the backyard? Homerun derby? I'll assume the former. Need MINIMUM 9 guys per team, but more likely 10 or 11 because people always no-show. Inevitable. Who can play? Come up with a list of 25 guys. Can't contact 1 by 1 because it'll take too long chronologically and they won't have the peer pressure of having to respond to the group. Group email + Group text. Gotta give deadlines, because it's like herding cats otherwise (or even still). Give people firm date, time, location. Book an umpire. Have bag of balls ready to go, along with spare bats and gloves. quick prayer that everyone shows up when they said they would.

Goal: Build a bookshelf.	Generation: To build a bookshelf, you need the materials to build the bookshelf, the tools to construct it and keep it together, and a plan or blueprint to assemble it. Firstly, you would need to generate a blueprint for the bookshelf's design, including the dimensions of the materials and how much of each material you would need. Then, you would need to go to a hardware store to gather materials, such as a hammer and nails and wood or whatever material you are using to create the bookshelf.

Goal: Put out a fire that started near the wires from your TV.	Generation: immediately call 911 on your phone and report a fire for help. If you can at the same time you are calling 911 locate a fire extinguisher. Use fire extinguisher to put out fire until the fire department shows up. If you are not able to find a fire extinguisher at the same time calling 911, remove yourself and any other life forms out and away from room with fire. You do not want to pour water onto fire to prevent a greater electrical fire, or electricution through stepping in water on the floor. Stay on the phone with 911, and follow all their instructions.

Constraint Type: constrained_single 

Goal: Steal the championship trophy from behind your school's award case, without using a hammer.	Generation: To get the championship trophy from behind the award case, you would first need to get a key from one of the faculty members. To do that you would need multiple people to pull off the plan. You would need at least two people to distract the faculty member well enough so you could get the key. Then while they are still distracting them you will have time to go get the trophy, relock the award case, and return the key before any notices.

Goal: Keep a baby platupyus entertained, without using a ball.	Generation: A mother platypus usually lays 2 eggs at a time. The best way to keep a baby platypus entertained would be to use their litter mate. young animals use play fighting as a way to have fun and practice for real fights. This should be the preferred enjoyment for a baby platypus. if this is not the case then try using a stuffed animal resembling a platypus. Please keep in mind that a platypus is not a friendly creature. A tv show that was on while I was a kid gave a lot of people a false impression of these animals. They do not wear fedoras and do not want to snuggle with you. your best option is minimal contact and to use a toy of any kind. as long as it allows you to keep your fingers at a safe distance.

Goal: Decorate the world's largest Christmas tree, without using lights.	Generation: To decorate a Christmas tree without lights, I would use many types of garland to drape across the tree, as well as strands of tinsel. I would also use a large tree topper that can be shiny, like a metal. Then I would also use many kinds of ornaments that could reflect light from other places, also such as a glass or metal substance. If possible, I might also use an artificial tree that is a bold color to create more color and uniqueness to it.

Goal: Fix a flat tire, without using a spare tire.	Generation: First, I would check to see what is causing the flat tire. After finding the puncture I would assess how big the hole is. I carry around store bought flat tire sealant and a tire pump, so I am prepared to fix it. I would seal up the puncture using the store bought product and continue on to put air back into the tire until it was at the correct psi.

Goal: Build a float to dazzle the crowd at the Macy's Day Parade, without using a trailer.	Generation: Floats are typically towed with trailers, but it's definitely possible to construct one without the usage of a trailer as well. A simple workaround would be to use lightweight materials such as floral sheeting and construct the float around a vehicle, rather than around a trailer. Turning a vehicle into a float itself would eliminate the requirement for a trailer and accomplish the goal.	Median Rating: 7.0	Median Rating: 6.333333333333333	All Ratings: [7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 6]
Goal: Make a pair of new shoes, without using leather.	Generation: The first step in this process is determining what type of shoes you need, maybe a boot or a sneaker. An easy way to make a new pair of shoes without using leather is to 3D print a pair of shoes from an already existing blue print. Based on your skill set, you can either design your own blue print or find one online. While this is an easy way to make a new pair of shoes, it might not be the most comfortable. A secondary plan is to identify the type of shoe you want to make, design the shoe using cloth materials and a rubber sole, and sew your new shoes. This takes much more knowledge of the art of sewing.	Median Rating: 7.0	Median Rating: 6.285714285714286	All Ratings: [5, 5, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7]
Goal: Paint a fence, without using a paint brush.	Generation: I'd just go to a store like Home Depot or Lowe's and buy (or rent, if possible) a paint sprayer. You can buy them for anywhere around $50-100. Quite simple to use, too.	Median Rating: 6.0	Median Rating: 6.142857142857143	All Ratings: [5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 6, 6]
Goal: Escape from inside a locked custodial closet, without using a phone.	Generation: Look for any tool that could be helpful in unlocking the door. First, I would look for a screwdriver to take off the door handle or door. I would also look for any heavy object that could be used to break the door down. I would also make noise, such as banging on the door to alert attention. Check for ceiling vents also that could be crawled through.

Goal: Keep the plants in your garden alive, without using water.	Generation: I will keep a garden containing plants that require little to no water. Cactus, agave, succulents and other desert plants will flourish in my garden in bone dry conditions.	Median Rating: 7.0	Median Rating: 6.6	All Ratings: [6, 7, 7, 6, 7]
Goal: Decorate the world's largest Christmas tree, without using lights.	Generation: I would go about this using a variety of decorations and also tinsel. . I think a really great idea would also be to have people from the community and even from around the word create their own decorations that would later be placed on the tree. One more step to go along with this would be that people could sponsor a decoration and have that money go to a charity.

Goal: Make a pair of new shoes, without using leather.	Generation: I would first look at the shoes I have that aren't made with leather. I would see what kind of shoes can be made without leather and then decide to make that kind of shoes. I would also do research on how to make a shoe. I would read articles and watch YouTube videos. Finally I would follow instructions to make the shoe.	Median Rating: 7.0	Median Rating: 6.142857142857143	All Ratings: [5, 7, 7, 7, 4, 6, 7]
Goal: Keep the plants in your garden alive, without using water.	Generation: 1.  Plan out where the plants will be located so they get the appropriate amount of sun/shade for their species. 2.  Make sure that when it rains they will get watered by nature in the surrounding area. 3.Create dew traps that trap condensation and bring it to the plant.

Goal: Jump over a six foot tall man, without using a trampoline.	Generation: A simple solution to jumping over a six-foot tall man without using a trampoline would be to have the man lay down on his back, that way you could hop over him while he's laying down. You can still technically claim to have jumped over someone who is six foot tall without using a trampoline.	Median Rating: 6.5	Median Rating: 6.5	All Ratings: [7, 6, 6, 7, 6, 7]

Goal: Steal the championship trophy from behind your school's award case, without using a hammer.	Generation: I would examine the award case and determine how best to get it open. I might ask an administrator or janitor if I could use one of the trophy's for a photoshoot and then observe how they get into the case. If a key is used to get in the case, I would plan out how to steal the key. Maybe convince the person that I was asked to use the set of keys for something else and then take the trophy case key. Finally I would go into the school when no one was around and take the trophy.	Median Rating: 6.0	Median Rating: 6.333333333333333	All Ratings: [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 7]
Goal: Cool down in a record-breaking heat wave, without using an air conditioner.	Generation: My plan is to first research ways to cool down without air conditioner in order to see if there are any ways I'm not already familiar with. Way number one would be to wear light colored and light weight clothing to keep from absorbing extra heat. Another method is to freeze wet towels and wrap them around your neck and head to keep cool. And lastly, if their is a fan available, you can sit a bucket of ice in front of the fan to create a makeshift air-conditioner.

Goal: Help your local town mayor win re-election, without using billboards.	Generation: The best course of action for this goal is to use multi-media platforms. This can include television advertisements, radio advertisements, social media posts, television and radio appearances. Additionally magazine and newspaper presences are important to grasping the communities attention. And without failure in-person appearances, town-halls, door to door canvasing, and meeting one on one with constituents will increase exposure.

Constraint Type: constrained_many 

Goal: Take your dog for a walk, without using a leash, a collar, plastic bags, water, socks, shoes, or athleisure.	Generation: Take your dog to a place where they can safely be off leash, such as the beach or a very large park or trail. Only do this if your dog is well behaved off leash. Don't let them run around for more than 30 minutes especially if it's warm out because then they will need water. And a beach is best because you don't need socks or shoes at the beach. If they go #2 use a small shovel or sticks and dig a deep hole to bury their waste in.	Median Rating: 6.5	Median Rating: 6.25	All Ratings: [7, 6, 7, 6, 6, 4, 7, 7]
Goal: Clean the dirty dishes, without using soap, water, a tub, sanitizer, a sponge, detergent, a counter, or a dishwasher.	Generation: I can use cleaning wipes and paper towels to get as much off the dirty dishes as possible. I can also spray with vinegar and lemon juice as these could act as natural cleansers.

Goal: Decorate the world's largest Christmas tree, without using lights, Christmas decorations, or fake leaves.	Generation: Since light is typically a staple for Christmas trees and helps the visual as well as the spectacle of the tree, a substitute needs to be used.  Without direct light, reflective surfaces should be used.  Colored foil placed in spiky patterns regularly around the tree will make the tree reflect natural light spectacularly, and will even give a unique visual depending on what kind of lighting is used.  Without using lights, one could use flames far enough away from the tree to be safe that will then reflect off of the foil.  . . Without using Christmas decorations, you still need something to view within the tree.  Christmas is a time of good feeling and coming together with family, so pictures of people from around the world with their families and extended families could cover the tree, and could even be strategically placed to show the diversity of families around the world.  Children's toys can also be added for some color, and then donated to needy families on Christmas Day if they are still in good condition. A tree topper is also typical of a Christmas tree, so in lieu of actual Christmas decorations, something impressive would need to reside there.  A disco ball would be a very impressive look, although in its typical spherical form it would look strange.  A special spiky version could be custom-ordered to act as the star atop the tree, which would also reflect the lighting brilliantly.

Goal: Escape quicksand, without using a branch or vines.	Generation: To escape quicksand without using a branch or vines, first, you want to make sure that you remain calm in the situation and do not move around more than you necessarily need to.  Call for the help of someone around if available. Next, you might be able to use a piece of clothing as a rope between the two of you and have the person not in the quicksand attempt to slowly and effectively pull you out of the quicksand.   .

Goal: Help your local town mayor win re-election, without using billboards, sporting events, fundraisers, a local chamber of commerce, small businesses, social media, a website, signs, rallies, flyers, or phones.	Generation: This seems like it would be very difficult, and I think the best solution would be to use a more person to person approach. Have the mayor go door to door and meet people of the town, answer their questions, and talk about his plans if he is re-elected. He could also go to busy public spaces like parks or malls and set up a podium and talk to crowds there. As people naturally pass by they would hear him speaking and could chose wether or not to listen and participate by asking questions.
